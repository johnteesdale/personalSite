            <p>Hey — I'm John, a UX and Product Designer based in Philly.</p>
            <p>I've spent the last 5+ years designing digital experiences that are clean, scalable, and grounded in actual user behavior. Whether it’s a B2C site with an 18% conversion rate or a B2B platform that cut bounce rates in half, I focus on clear hierarchy, thoughtful interaction, and collaboration with developers and stakeholders.</p>
            <p>I'm also really into design systems, Figma components, and figuring out how to make handoff less painful for everyone involved. I taught UX and web design at the University of the Arts until it shut down in 2024—something that helped me become better at explaining ideas and thinking critically about design choices.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I play in a weekly dodgeball league (it's more intense than you'd think) and spend a lot of time painting tiny, highly detailed Warhammer miniatures. I’ve included some photos below—because designing stuff big and small is kind of my thing.</p>
            <p>Want to work together or just talk shop?</p>
