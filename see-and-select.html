      <p>See & Select is an annual event hosted by VoiceComm to facilitar relationships between their customers and vendors in preparation for that year's iPhone launch. iPhone launches are a major revenue generator for most cell phone stores. See & Selects helps customers plan the purchases for the new iPhone in advance so that they can have all the accessories needed when a new iPhone launches.</p>

        <h2>See & Select 2021</h2>
        <p>See & Select was launched in 2021. The first See & Select was hosted completely virtual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the event was hosted on line we still wanted to offer personal experience for the customers. To achieve that I designed virtual meeting bingo cards, door hangers and a number of other personalized items for the event. Additionally, a custom landing page with the events details and itinerary was also built and designed.</p>

        <h2>See & Select 2022</h2>
        <p>See & Select 2022 was able to be held in-person. A number of assets were reused from the previous years See & Select. New materials that had to be created for the event were 96‚Äù pull-up banners, and name tags.</p>
