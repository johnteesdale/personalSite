        <h3>Project Intro</h3>
        <p>See & Select is an annual event hosted by VoiceComm to facilitate relationships between their VIP customers and vendors in preparation for that year's iPhone launch. iPhone launches are a significant revenue generator for most cell phone stores. See & Selects helps customers plan their purchases for the new iPhone in advance so that they can have all the accessories needed when a new iPhone launches.</p>
        <p>The design goal of See & Select is to provide VoiceComm's most valuable customers with bespoke valuable experience. Customers should feel like they are getting top-of-the-line experience and getting an extra head start on getting accessories for the biggest sales event of the year.</p>

          <h2>Staying Connected During Covid in 2021</h2>
          <p>See & Select was launched in 2021. The first See & Select was hosted completely virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the event was hosted online we still wanted to offer a personal experience for the customers.</p>
          <p>To achieve that a virtual meeting big box was designed for all participants. This included bingo cards, door hangers, and other personalized items for the event. A custom landing page with the event details and itinerary was also built and designed to help everyone stay on top of the many meeting available.</p>
