          <h2>The Selling Power of<br> Brand Names</h2>
          <p>This was a creative request by a sales representative to help convenience a major customer to switch from selling no-name brand cases to selling name-brand cases and products through VoiceComm. 1 month after the launch of the campaign the customer put in an order of 14 SKUs for a total of $204,000.</p>

            <h2>Screen Protectors for All Phones on Demand</h2>
            <p>ISOD was a new product that experienced success in the EU and was being brought over to America for the first time by VoiceComm. This product was primarily marketed to phone repair stores as they typically see a larger varsity of cell phones and this product would allow them to sell a screen project for any phone while also lowering the SKUs in store. This marketing initiative led to over 50 stores bringing ISOD into their doors.</p>

                <h2>Prepairing for Device Launches</h2>
                <p>Device launches for both the Samsung Galaxy and the Apple iPhone are VoiceCommâ€™s largest sales day. VoiceComm needs to facilitate the easy purchasing of SKUs for both of these launches. Every year a new landing page is created which acts as a directory for customers to quickly find the SKUs for the new products they are looking for. These pages each have over 20,000 impressions, and 5,000 clicks, and lead to over $800,000 in sales.</p>
