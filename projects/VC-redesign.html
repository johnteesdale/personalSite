            <h3>Project Intro</h3>
            <p>VoiceComm's existing website, originally designed in 2016, has become outdated in light of the significant growth and transformative changes the company has undergone since then. Recognizing the need to align the digital presence with these advancements, the board of directors initiated a comprehensive website overhaul.</p>
            <p>This initiative aimed not only to refresh the website's appearance but also to effectively capture and communicate the organizational evolution and expansion. Concurrently, an opportunity was seized to segregate the e-commerce and brochure segments of the website. This strategic division yielded a host of advantages, including enhanced Search Engine Optimization (SEO) capabilities for both sections. Moreover, the migration from a custom-built platform devoid of a Content Management System (CMS) to HubSpot was undertaken, leveraging the latter's robust CMS functionalities.</p>
            <p>The directive to orchestrate this redesign was entrusted to the Creative Department, with the mantle of leadership falling upon my role as the in-house digital designer. This undertaking encompassed a multifaceted array of responsibilities, spanning the orchestration and delineation of the design and development workflow, the facilitation of workshops aimed at content generation in collaboration with leadership and colleagues, and the principal design architectonics for the new website.</p>

                <h2>Beginning a Redesign Right</h2>
                <p>The inception of the website rejuvenation was marked by a meticulous delineation of the project's scope, followed by its granulation into manageable phases. Essential roles were assigned, and a preliminary timeline was outlined to provide a projected chronology of project completion. With an endorsement from the company's upper echelons, my focus shifted to a comprehensive exploration of competitors' websites, prevailing design trends, and contemporary web design best practices.</p>

These personas not only informed the present project's user experience design but also laid the foundation for future digital undertakings.</p>

                <p>Leveraging the personas derived from this workshop, collaborative efforts ensued with the Marketing Manager and the Vice President of Core Business. This collaboration engendered a delineation of page content and copywriting, a process in which I played an instrumental role.

                <p>Upon crystallization of the final content strategy, concerted collaboration was undertaken with the Creative Director and Senior Designer to craft high-fidelity mockups. These mockups, refined through Figma, facilitated the generation of prototypes, crucial in presenting the envisaged design and User Experience (UX) paradigms to the company's leadership. Figma's advanced prototyping capabilities were fully harnessed, affording an optimal visual representation of the proposed website design and its inherent UX facets.</p>
